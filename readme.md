### Objective
This webpage is designed to track satellite which is flying over us
### Description
* When I use the website, I can look for the satellite passing by my current location or I can search for the city to track     the satellite for that particular city.
* Then we provided a satellite category to look for the particlar category.Each category is mapped with an category ID.
* when submitting,the N2YO API calls and displays the satellite with detailed information includes satellite name and           satellite ID,elevation and azimuth(Which direction to face and elevation above the horizon in degrees)
* Used openweather API to get the city name and viewing condition.
* When I do a search for city,it will save my search history into local storage and the latest search city on the top
* By using Uphere rapid API,it will give the description and provides wiki link about the satellite(Sometime the APIs is not giving the description and link,In that case,displayed as description or link not found)
